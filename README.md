# 🎄 Christmas Gacha

A personal, interactive Christmas experience built with code — not design tools.

This project was created as a one-time Christmas gift for a single person. ❤️  
It is not a public service, not a commercial product, and not meant to scale.

Just a small world made with care.

## ✨ Concept

Christmas Gacha is an interactive web experience where a user:

1. Enters a calm Christmas landing scene
2. Chooses a “fate card” with fixed probabilities
3. Starts a gacha animation filled with suspense
4. Receives a final gift result with a visual reveal

The focus is not efficiency or monetization —  
it’s **emotion, anticipation, and surprise**.

- No backend

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

This project exists because:

- I wanted to create something **by hand**
- I wanted to explore **visual expression through code**
- I wanted to make a Christmas gift that couldn’t be bought or copied

The value of this project is not in how many users it has,  
but **who it was made for**.

## 📌 Notes

This project will not be maintained after Christmas.  
It is meant to live as a moment, not a product.

**Made with care, code, and winter nights.**
